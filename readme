The Network Packet Analyzer is a lightweight Python tool designed to capture and analyze network packets in real time. It provides valuable insights by extracting key information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP), and payload data. This tool is simple to use and outputs data in a clear, readable format. It is ideal for educational purposes and emphasizes ethical usage in controlled environments. With minimal setup requirements, including Python 3.x, the scapy library, and administrative privileges, users can quickly monitor live network traffic. Future enhancements may include features like log saving, advanced filtering, and a user-friendly graphical interface
